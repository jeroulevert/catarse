        h2 What's Ride-lab.com ?
        p Ride-Lab.com is a crowdfunding website around sport. The original purpose is to provide a way of financing all kind of projects concerning mountain bike, surf, ski, snowboardâ€¦ every freeride sport ! Ride-Lab will help small companies to create new and original sporting devices. We strongly believe crowfunding can be the ideal way of financing the creation of custom devices.
        p When a project is successful, reaching or exceeding the amount requested, the total raised is passed from the BACKERS on to the CREATOR, and it is discounted due to the percentage charged by the platform and the tariffs charged by the online payment services. Conversely, if a project is not successful, failing to reach the amount requested, the BACKERS get back the value of their contributions through credit at RIDE-LAB.COM or trough refund.
        p RIDE-LAB.COM only approximates PROJECT CREATORS and BACKERS. Using RIDE-LAB.COM does not generate employment relationship, association or society among users and RIDE-LAB.COM, nor represents business transaction or sale of products or services.
        p RIDE-LAB.COM is responsible for the smooth functioning of its website. However, RIDE-LAB.COM does not guarantee that the projects will be executed nor that the incentives/rewards will be honored, exempting itself from liability over it, which is agreed expressly by CREATORS and BACKERS and shall resolve any issues directly with each other .
